## Step 8: Binding a method

Since we created a method that changes a state variable, we have to bind it to our class. Then, when we call it, we know what method to reference.

### :keyboard: Activity: Bind `addStudent` to `App`

1. Uncomment line 18 of `src/App.jsx` to bind `addStudent` to `App`
2. Save your changes
3. To run your code, move inside your repo folder in your terminal and run `npm start`
4. Exit the process in your terminal using `Ctrl + C`
5. Stage, commit, and push your changes to the `changes` branch:
    ```
    git add src/App.jsx
    git commit -m "bind addStudent to App"
    git push
    ```
