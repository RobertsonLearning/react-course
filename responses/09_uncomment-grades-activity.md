## Step 10: Include Grades

Let's get our grades working! At the end of this activity, your code should now be able to add assignments, students, and grades.

### :keyboard: Activity: Uncomment the grades conditional in `src/App.jsx`

1. In the `src/App.jsx` file, uncomment the conditional statement between lines 77 and 86 for our `grades` tab
2. Save your changes
3. To run your code, move inside your repo folder in your terminal and run `npm start`
4. Exit the process using `Ctrl + C`
5. Stage, commit, and push your changes to the `changes` branch:
    ```
    git add src/App.jsx
    git commit -m "uncomment grades section"
    git push
    ```
